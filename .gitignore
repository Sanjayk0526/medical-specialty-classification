Hereâ€™s the `.gitignore` file for your project:

```
# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd

# Virtual environments
env/
venv/
.venv/

# Model files
*.joblib
*.pkl

# Kaggle credentials
kaggle.json
```

This will make sure unnecessary files (cache, environments, large model files, and your private Kaggle API key) are not uploaded to GitHub.
